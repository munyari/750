# 750

A clone of [750 Words](http://750words.com/).

## Rationale

Writing is a good habit to develop. It allows you to sort out your thoughts, or
let out your frustrations; it is a simultaneously creative and cathartic act.
[750 Words](http://750words.com/) is a great concept, designed to get you to
"just write something everyday". You can read more about the concept on their
website. The service is not without its problems though.

## Issues

- **750 words has no privacy policy.** No guarantees are made about what is
  happening with your private data.
- **750 words is not free (as in beer).** The service offers a free trial, and
  then costs \$5 a month. While I found the service worthwhile, I frankly did
  not think something I could throw together in a bash script was worth paying
  \$60 a year.
- **750 words in not free (as in freedom).** It's always nice to support free
  software where possible. In building my alternative to 750 words, I am 100%
  committed to [preserving the freedom of the
  user](http://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software)

## Features

## Planned Features
- Vim/Neovim integration. Possibly with airline/powerline/lightline, or just the
  bare statusline.
- Ability to view statistics and visualization of your writing data
  (matplotlib?)
